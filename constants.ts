It's written in the stars we gaze at, in the way our hands fit together, in every shared smile and quiet moment.\n\nSo here's my promise: Iâ€™ll keep writing this love, every day, in every way, with you by my side. This is not just a chapter; it's our forever story.\n\nWith all my love, now and always."
